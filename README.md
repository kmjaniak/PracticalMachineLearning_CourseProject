# PracticalMachineLearning_CourseProject

This is the final course project for Coursera's Practical Machine Learning course as part of the Data Science Specialization.

In this project, I use data obtained from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har to practice building machine learning models to classify activities. The data represent measurements taken by wearable devices as participants perform dumbell curls in five different manners (classes):

* Class A: Exercise performed correctly
* Class B: Throwing the elbows to the front
* Class C: Lifting the dumbell only halfway
* Class D: Lowering the dumbell only halfway
* Class E: Throwing the hips to the front

The RMarkdown file in this repository contains code for building and exploring decision tree and random forest models to classify the manner in which dumbell curls were performed.
